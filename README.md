# pulsar-client-cpp-bundle

This is the binary static library of the [Apache Pulsar™ C++ client library](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-cpp), packaged as a Swift Artifact Bundle and adapted header files to ensure interop with Swift. The binaries themselves are unchanged and are coming directly from the [download page](https://pulsar.apache.org/download/#pulsar-c-client).
